## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
- API key for your chosen provider (or local LLM service like Ollama)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dotcommander/roleplay.git
cd roleplay

# Install globally
go install

# Or build locally
go build -o roleplay
```

#### Option 2: Install from release

```bash
# Download the latest release for your platform
curl -L https://github.com/dotcommander/roleplay/releases/latest/download/roleplay-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x roleplay
sudo mv roleplay /usr/local/bin/
```

### First Run

```bash
# Run the setup wizard (recommended)
roleplay init

# Or manually set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # For OpenAI
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"   # For Anthropic
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"  # For Ollama

# Quick start with built-in Rick Sanchez character
roleplay demo

# Or start interactive chat with any character
roleplay interactive --character rick-c137 --user your-name
```

## üìñ Usage

### Character Management

```bash
# List all characters
roleplay character list

# Create a character from JSON
roleplay character create character.json

# Import character from markdown (AI-powered)
roleplay import ~/Documents/my-character.md

# Show character details
roleplay character show character-id

# Generate example character JSON
roleplay character example > my-character.json
```

### Chat Commands

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended) - Beautiful TUI
roleplay interactive --character rick-c137 --user your-name

# Single message chat
roleplay chat "Hello!" --character rick-c137 --user your-name

# Demo mode - Shows caching performance
roleplay demo
```

### Session Management

```bash
# List all sessions
roleplay session list

# Show session statistics (cache performance)
roleplay session stats
```

## üé≠ Example Characters

The system includes Rick Sanchez as a built-in demo character. You can import many more characters from markdown files or create your own!

### Example Characters Available

Check the `examples/characters/` directory for ready-to-use character files:
- **Sophia the Philosopher** - Thoughtful thinker who guides through questions
- **Captain Rex Thunderbolt** - Bold adventurer and sky pirate
- **Dr. Luna Quantum** - Meticulous quantum physicist

### Importing Characters from Markdown

You can import characters from unstructured markdown files using AI:

```bash
# Import a character from any markdown file
roleplay import ~/Documents/character-description.md

# The AI will analyze the file and extract:
# - Character name and personality
# - OCEAN personality traits
# - Speech patterns and quirks
# - Background story
```

### Creating Your Own Character

Create a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Example Character",
  "backstory": "Character's background story...",
  "personality": {
    "openness": 0.8,
    "conscientiousness": 0.6,
    "extraversion": 0.7,
    "agreeableness": 0.8,
    "neuroticism": 0.3
  },
  "speech_style": "How the character speaks...",
  "quirks": ["quirk1", "quirk2"],
  "current_mood": {
    "joy": 0.7,
    "surprise": 0.3,
    "anger": 0.1,
    "fear": 0.2,
    "sadness": 0.1,
    "disgust": 0.1
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The easiest way to configure roleplay is using the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
roleplay init
```

This will guide you through:
- Choosing your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Configuring API endpoints and keys
- Setting default models
- Creating example characters

### Manual Configuration

Create `~/.config/roleplay/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Provider profile name (used for config resolution)
provider: openai  # or anthropic, ollama, gemini, etc.

# API Configuration
api_key: your-api-key-here
base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional, for custom endpoints
model: gpt-4o-mini

# Caching Configuration
cache:
  max_entries: 10000
  cleanup_interval: 5m
  default_ttl: 10m
  adaptive_ttl: true

# Memory System
memory:
  short_term_window: 20
  medium_term_duration: 24h
  consolidation_rate: 0.1

# Personality Evolution
personality:
  evolution_enabled: true
  max_drift_rate: 0.02
  stability_threshold: 10
```

### Supported Providers

Roleplay uses a unified OpenAI-compatible provider that works with:

- **OpenAI** - Official OpenAI API
- **Anthropic** - Claude models via OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Google Gemini** - Via OpenAI-compatible proxy
- **Ollama** - Local models (no API key required)

- **Groq** - Fast inference cloud service
- **OpenRouter** - Access multiple providers
- **Any OpenAI-compatible API** - Custom endpoints

### Environment Variables

```bash
# General configuration
export ROLEPLAY_PROVIDER=openai
export ROLEPLAY_API_KEY=your-api-key
export ROLEPLAY_BASE_URL=https://api.custom.com/v1
export ROLEPLAY_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Provider-specific API keys (auto-detected)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...

# Local services
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
export ROLEPLAY_CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL=10m
export ROLEPLAY_CACHE_ADAPTIVE_TTL=true
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 4-Layer Caching System

1. **Admin/System Layer** - Global system prompts (24h+ TTL)
2. **Character Personality Layer** - Core traits and backstory (6-12h TTL)
3. **User Memory Layer** - User-specific relationships (1-3h TTL)
4. **Current Chat History** - Recent conversation (5-15m TTL)

### Key Components

- **Character System**: OCEAN personality model with emotional states
- **Memory System**: Three-tier memory with emotional weighting
- **Cache System**: Dual caching (prompt + response) with adaptive TTL
- **Provider Factory**: Centralized AI provider initialization and management
- **Provider Abstraction**: Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)

## üìä Performance

- **90% cost reduction** through intelligent caching
- **Adaptive TTL** extends cache duration for active conversations
- **Background workers** for cache cleanup and memory consolidation
- **Thread-safe** operations throughout
